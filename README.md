# Time Series Classification 
The work of Dr. Eamonn Keogh at University of California Riverside has shown that a good way to classify time series is with a k-NN algorithm using a dynamic time warping similarity measure.

This repo is meant to implement this time series classification method in the Julia Programminng Language.
